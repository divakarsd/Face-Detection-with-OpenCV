# Face-Detection-with-OpenCV
## Face Detection with OpenCV and Deep learning in Python

You can perform fast, accurate face detection with OpenCV using a pre-trained deep learning face detector model shipped with the library.

You may already know that OpenCV ships out-of-the-box with ***pre-trained Haar cascades*** that can be used for face detection…

…but I’m willing to bet that you don’t know about the “hidden” deep learning-based face detector that has been part of OpenCV since OpenCV 3.3.

***This project is based on pre-trained Caffe-based face detector deep learnig model.***

When using OpenCV’s deep neural network module with Caffe models, you’ll need two sets of files:

********The .prototxt file(s) which define the model architecture (i.e., the layers themselves)********

********The .caffemodel file which contains the weights for the actual layers********

********Both files are required when using models trained using Caffe for deep learning.********
